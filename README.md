# Customer Churn Prediction in Telecommunications-Machine Learning Classification Project
This repository contains a machine learning project focused on predicting customer churn in the telecommunications industry. Customer churn refers to the phenomenon where customers discontinue using a company's services. Understanding and predicting churn is crucial for telecom companies to retain customers and maintain profitability.

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to develop a predictive model that can accurately identify customers who are likely to churn. By analyzing a comprehensive dataset provided by a telecom company, we aim to uncover patterns, relationships, and key factors influencing churn. The project involves data exploration, preprocessing, feature engineering, model development, evaluation, and interpretation.

## Key Features
**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Gain insights into the dataset and understand the distribution, relationships, and characteristics of the variables.

**Missing Value Handling:** Address missing values in the dataset using appropriate imputation or removal techniques.

**Feature Engineering:** Transform and create new features to enhance the predictive power of the models.

**Model Development:** Utilize various machine learning algorithms to develop predictive models for customer churn.

**Model Evaluation:** Assess the performance of the developed models using appropriate evaluation metrics.

**Model Interpretation:** Interpret the models to understand the factors driving customer churn and their relative importance.
